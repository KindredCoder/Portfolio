•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  o	Record all needs and wants of the stakeholders and place them as a priority. This is done by completing a user stories document for your project team,
    	This also requires listing expectations that need to be fulfilled so that developers can understand fully what they need to code to ensure that all needs and expectations are met.
    	These stories and their priorities also assist developers in identifying the critical needs of stakeholders and front-loading them if needed.
•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  o	Before this class, I resorted to primarily waterfall methods which didn’t ever pay off and left a ton of projects not meeting my co-workers' expectations, which resulted in a large amount of wasted time and little payoff. 
  o	In the future, I plan to use more agile methods to document stakeholder needs, catalog them, and set clear expectations of the project ahead of time. This also means that I need to address future feedback from the stakeholders to meet any changes or additional expectations if they arise. 
•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  o	I believe as a good team member, it will require you to be active and open to changes which require you to be flexible and open to changes if needed. Understanding that you may be good at your skills doesn’t mean that you should ever “Gatekeeping” your knowledge to ensure job security or self-importance. 
  o	Allow both your knowledge and skills to be shared through your team to improve yourself by fully understanding what you may not be but allowing others to improve using your skills and knowledge as well, which improves your team overall.
