Produced by Kyle Gibson

I started this Portfolio Project in the spring of 2024 to build my knowledge and start learning Web Development.
I currently plan to maintain this small website to allow others to view my projects or even contact me in the future.

Currently know and understand HTML and CSS well, but need to learn more about JavaScript.
Plan on using frameworks in the future to assist me on this quest, like React and BootStrap.

Please contact me at kyle.gibson2@snhu.edu if you have questions about any of my current or past projects.
